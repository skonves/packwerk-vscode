This is a collection of some relatively unorganized notes for people interested in developing on this extension.

## Future Features
- automatically update deprecated references
  - possibly allow for updating a single file rather than a pack. This would require changes to packwerk to support update-deprecations working correctly on a single file.
- click to open public API where constant lives

## Future work items
- add the ability to publish the extension from CI. vsce tool let’s you do package and publish. If you do publish there is a signing step that happens, keys to setup, etc. If you don’t do that, you package it in CI or local and upload it in the extension marketplace.
- Add buildkite CI support and add proper testing
